## note-taker

## Overview:

For this unit, we continue to gain the relevant skillset(s) to create back-end web applications. Express is a web app that allows us to do just that.
Per the instructions for this week's assignment, we were to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. Again, this application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from the provided JSON file.

Please find additional information regarding this project below. Thank you.
